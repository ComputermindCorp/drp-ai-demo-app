## Application: Build Stage

>**Note:** User can skip to the [next stage (deploy)](#application-deploy-stage) if they do not want to build the application.  
All pre-built binaries are provided.

### Prerequisites
This section, it is necessary to have completed up to Step 5 of the [Getting Started Guide](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/5.20/getting_started.html) provided by Renesas.<br>

After completion of the above steps, the user is expected of following things.
- AI SDK setup is done.
- Following docker container is running on the host machine.

    | Board | Docker container |
    |---|---|
    | RZ/V2H EVK and RZ/V2N EVK | `rzv2h_ai_sdk_container`  |

    >**Note 1:** Docker environment is required for building the sample application.  
    **Note 2:** Since RZ/V2N is a brother chip of RZ/V2H, the same environment can be used.

### Application File Generation
1. On your host machine, copy the sources you want to build to the desired location. 

    1. Copy the source to be built to the `data` folder mounted in the Docker container.

        > /drp-ai_tvm/data/C03_surface_anomaly_detection/src
    
2. Run (or start) the docker container and open the bash terminal on the container.  
  E.g., for RZ/V2H and RZ/V2N, use the `rzv2h_ai_sdk_container` as the name of container created from  `rzv2h_ai_sdk_image` docker image.  

   > Note that all the build steps/commands listed below are executed on the docker container bash terminal.  

3. Set your clone directory to the environment variable.  
    ```sh
    export PROJECT_PATH=/drp-ai_tvm/data/C03_surface_anomaly_detection
    ```        
4. Go to the application source code directory.  
    ```sh
    cd ${PROJECT_PATH}/src 
    ```

5. Create and move to the `build` directory.
    ```sh
    mkdir -p build 
    cd build
    ```
6. Build the application by following the commands below.  
    ```sh
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./toolchain/runtime.cmake -DV2H=ON ..
    make -j$(nproc)
    ```
7. The following application file would be generated in the `${PROJECT_PATH}/src/build` directory
    - app_patch_core_demo


### Memory Bank File Generation

Default memory banks are created using the wood data set.<br> 
If this is customized by the user, a new memory bank must be created.<br>
Generate a binary file for the memory bank according to [Memory Bank File Generation](https://github.com/ComputermindCorp/patchcore/blob/main/src/tools/drp_ai/README.md).

After creating the new memory bank, change the following static variable in `src/define.h` to match the file name you created before the [Application File Generation](#application-file-generation).

```cpp
const static std::string mem_bank_name = "resnet18_quantization_onnx_size224_param_0.0002_9.bin";
```

## Application: Deploy Stage

    >**Note:** Since RZ/V2N is a brother chip of RZ/V2H, the same environment can be used.

    - Sample models and Data
        ```sh
        cd C03_surface_anomaly_detection/<EXE_DIR>
        wget https://github.com/ComputermindCorp/drp-ai-demo-app/releases/download/v5.20/input_data_1.zip
        unzip input_data_1.zip
        ```
        > It includes default memory bank binary file and default image files for use in camera mode.
    - deploy.so
        ```sh
        cd C03_surface_anomaly_detection/<EXE_DIR>/patch_core_demo
        wget https://github.com/ComputermindCorp/drp-ai-demo-app/releases/download/v5.20/C03_surface_anomaly_detection_deploy_tvm_v2h-v230.so
        ```

2. Rename the `C03_surface_anomaly_detection_deploy_*.so` to `deploy.so`. 

    ```sh
    mv C03_surface_anomaly_detection_deploy_tvm_v2h-v230.so deploy.so
    ```

        └── C03_surface_anomaly_detection/  
            ├── src/
            ├── exe/
            │   └── patch_core_demo/ <-- deploy.so
            ├── etc/ 
            ├── img/ 
            └── README.md  

3. Copy the following files to the `/home/root/tvm` directory of the rootfs (SD Card) for the board.
    |File | Details |
    |---|---|
    |All files in [exe](./exe)  directory | Including `deploy.so` file. |
    |`app_patch_core_demo` application file | Generated the file according to [Application File Generation](#application-file-generation) |

4. Check if `libtvm_runtime.so` exists under `/usr/lib64` directory of the rootfs (SD card) on the board.

5. Folder 
structure in the rootfs (SD Card) would look like:
    ```sh
    ├── usr/
    │       └── libtvm_runtime.so
    └── home/
        └── root/
            └── tvm/ 
                ├── patch_core_demo/
                │   ├── preprocess
                │   ├── deploy.json
                │   ├── deploy.params
                │   ├── deploy.so
                │   └── input_0.bin
                ├── input_data_1/
                │   ├── XXXXX.bin
                │   └── XXXXX.png
                └── app_patch_core_demo
    ```
>**Note:** The directory name could be anything instead of `tvm`. If you copy the whole `EXE_DIR` folder 
on the board, you are not required to rename it `tvm`.

>**Note:** The folder name could be anything instead of `input_data_1`. 
To change the folder name, specify the new folder name in the command line argument when executing the application.

>**Note:** If the user builds an application, 
it may be necessary to store memory bank binary and image files accordingly.
Image files store any number of 512x512 sized images in PNG format.
Generate a binary file for the memory bank according to [Memory Bank File Generation](https://github.com/ComputermindCorp/patchcore/blob/main/src/tools/drp_ai/README.md).


## Application: Run Stage

### Prerequisites
This section expects the user to have completed Step 7-3 of [Getting Started Guide](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/5.20/getting_started_v2h.html#step7-3) provided by Renesas. 

After completion of the guide, the user is expected of following things.  
- The board setup is done.  
- The board is booted with microSD card, which contains the application file.  

### Instruction
1. On Board terminal, go to the `tvm` directory of the rootfs.
    ```sh
    cd /home/root/tvm
    ```

2. Run the application.
    ```sh
    chmod +x app_patch_core_demo
    ./app_patch_core_demo APP_MODE FILE_PATH
    ```
    >**Note:** The `chmod` command is only necessary if the application does not have execution permission. 
    - The argument `APP_MODE` is chosen from `0`(Image mode) or `1`(Camera mode).
    - The argument `FILE_PATH` is the input data folder path.

3. Following window shows up on HDMI screen.

    | Result screen | <img src=./img/result_screen.png width=300>|
    >*Performance in the screenshot is for RZ/V2H EVK.
    
    The application window consists of two screens: the main screen and the results display screen.
    - On main screen, following information is displayed.  
      - Input mode (Image Mode or Camera Mode) and Description.
      - Input data
        - Image Mode: Select the image to be inferred using the left and right selection buttons.
        - Camera Mode: Align the inference target with the center rectangle
      - Start button
    - On results display screen, following information is displayed. 
      - Processing time  
        - TVM Pre-Processing: Processing time taken for AI pre-processing.  
        - TVM (Inference + Data loading): Processing time taken for AI inference.  
        - CPU Post-Processing: Processing time taken for AI post-processing.
      - AI inference result
        - Result: OK or NG
        - Anomaly Score: Distance from normal data (0.00 - 1.00)
        - NG Threshold: Abnormality threshold
    
4. To terminate the application, press the Cross button in the upper right corner of the main screen.

>**Note:** Since RZ/V2N is a brother chip of RZ/V2N, the same execution environment is used, which causes inconsistency in display contents,  
i.e, RZ/V2N application log contains "RZ/V2H". This will be solved in the future version.
